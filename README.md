# e-reader

This is a makeshift E-Reader I made in my EECS 285 class, Fall 2016. <br>
This class introduced me to Java Programming. <br>
Coding language is Java, I make use of Java's API. 

###Lessons: <br>
This is the first time I have used Java's GUI features. <br>
We weren't required to make the search feature work. Therefore, it doesn't. <br>

###Controls: <br>
Browse through different books and pages by clicking the drop down and buttons.

###Files: <br>
prototypeFrame.java - All the E-Readers functions are coded in here. <br>
test.java - What I used to test my E-Reader.
